              <h2>Abstract</h2>
              <p>
                  Botanical web manager is an
                  application whose goal is to give access to the public to complex information
                  on the collection of plants which can be found in a specific botanic garden. Up
                  until now it was only possible to gain such knowledge by being present at the place,
                  and was often impossible to gain access to the information you were being
                  display and often forced to spend the whole time on researching/documenting
                  each object that was posing an interest. By migrating the information into a
                  web application, it will allow each visitor to retrieve information on a
                  specific plant at any given moment and from any location.
              </p>

        <h2>General purposee</h2>



              <p>The application is intended to
              give free access to the information on all the plants of the given botanical
              garden. It also included the possibility of updating it with new information.
              The user can perform a complex
              search on the subject that it is interested in, and given the option of
              exporting the information in various formats such as CSV, XML. ;The search can be performed on multiple
              criteria, such as English name/Latin name, description, origin, the location
              where the plants can be found, the option of displaying images of it,
              reproduction, benefits, the purpose its servers (ornament, scent, medicinal),
              the environment where it grows (open field, greenhouse).

              <h2>Application scheme</h2>

              <p> We have devised the following
              schema which will help in building the frame of the application and based on
              which we have built the application modules</p>
